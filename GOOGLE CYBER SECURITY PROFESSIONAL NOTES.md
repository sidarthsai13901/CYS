- Responsibilities of cyber security Analyst
   
  Security analysts also proactively work to prevent threats from happening in the first place. One way they do this is by working with information technology, or IT, teams to install prevention software for the purposes of identifying risks and vulnerabilities.
  A security audit is a review of an organization's security records, activities, and other related documents.
Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.

Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.

Security posture is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.

A threat actor, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.

An internal threat can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor intentionally engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.

Network security is the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network.

Cloud security is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.

Programming is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:

-PROXY SERVER
 The proxy server is dedeicated se3rver that sits between the internet, thre prozy server will determine if connection request is safe.
The proxy serever is a public IP address from malicious actors on internet and adds a layer of security.
A proxy server use temprorary memory to stroe data that's regulary requested by external servers.
 Types of proxy servers that support network security.
  -> Forward proxy server: resitict and regualates person with internet acess.
      goal is to hide a User's IP address and approve all out going requests.
  -> Reverse proxy server: resitrict internet acess to the internal server.
      goal is to accept traffic from external parties approve it and forward it to the internel servers.
      useful for protecting intetnal web servers conntaing confidential data from exposing their IP address
      to exteral parties.
      An email proxy serve is another valuable security tool. It Filets spam email by verifiying whether a sender's adress was forged.
      This reduce the risk of phsihing attacks that impersonate people known to the organization.

WireGuard and IPSec are two different VPN protocols used to encrypt traffic over a secure network tunnel. 
The majority of VPN providers offer a variety of options for VPN protocols, such as WireGuard or IPSec. Ultimately, choosing between IPSec and WireGuard depends on many factors, including connection speeds, compatibility with existing network infrastructure, and business or individual needs.
